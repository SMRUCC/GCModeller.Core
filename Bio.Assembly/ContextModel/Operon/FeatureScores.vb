    ''' <summary>
    ''' To evaluate the contribution of selected features in operon prediction, we have calculated 
    ''' the numerical values of the features, And then used these values individually And in combination 
    ''' to train a classifier. The features used in our study are
    ''' 
    ''' + (i)   the intergenic distance, 
    ''' + (ii)  the conserved gene neighborhood, 
    ''' + (iii) distances between adjacent genes' phylogenetic profiles, 
    ''' + (iv)  the ratio between the lengths of two adjacent genes And 
    ''' + (v)   frequencies Of specific DNA motifs in the intergenic regions.
