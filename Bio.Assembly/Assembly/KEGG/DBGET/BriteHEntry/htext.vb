    ''' <summary>
    ''' KEGG BRITE is a collection of manually created hierarchical text (htext) files capturing 
    ''' functional hierarchies of various biological objects, especially those represented as 
    ''' KEGG objects. In contrast to KEGG PATHWAY, which is limited to molecular interactions and 
    ''' reactions, KEGG BRITE incorporates many different types of relationships. 
    '''
    ''' Some BRITE hierarchy files are computationally expanded, adding a hierarchy level Or a 
    ''' tab-delimited column, by incorporating additional information. This Is accomplished by the 
    ''' Join Brite operation Of KEGG Mapper, which combines a BRITE hierarchy file (such As ATC 
    ''' drug classification) And a binary relation file (such As D number To target relationships 
    ''' extracted from KEGG DRUG). 
    '''
    ''' Some other BRITE hierarchy files contain tab-delimited attributes that are manually added. 
    ''' Recently introduced BRITE table files are essentailly the same As such multi-column BRITE 
    ''' hierarchy files. Because the table representation Is often easier To understand, certain 
    ''' hierarchy files For disease And drug information have been converted To table files.
