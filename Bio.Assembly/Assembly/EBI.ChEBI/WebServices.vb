    ''' <summary>
    ''' The main aim of ChEBI Web Services is to provide programmatic access 
    ''' to the ChEBI database in order to aid our users in integrating ChEBI 
    ''' into their applications. Web Services is an integration technology. 
    ''' To ensure software from various sources work well together, this 
    ''' technology is built on open standards such as Simple Object Access 
    ''' Protocol (SOAP), a messaging protocol for transporting information, 
    ''' Web Services Description Language (WSDL), a standard method of describing 
    ''' Web Services and their capabilities. For the transport layer itself, 
    ''' Web Services utilise most of the commonly available network protocols, 
    ''' especially Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    '''
    ''' ChEBI provides SOAP access To its database. If you just wish To obtain 
    ''' light weight ontology objects you can use the Ontology Lookup Service 
    ''' As alternative Web Services.
